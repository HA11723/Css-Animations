# Css-Animations


I've created a comprehensive collection of 10 advanced CSS animations that showcase modern, professional techniques. Here's what each animation demonstrates:

Key Features:

Morphing Loader: Shape transformation with rotation and scaling
Floating Elements: Synchronized particles with staggered timing
Liquid Button: Interactive ripple effect on hover
Glitch Text: Cyberpunk-style RGB separation effect
Pulse Wave: Radar-style expanding rings
Loading Dots: Sequential wave animation
3D Flip Card: Perspective-based card flip
Neon Glow: Pulsating multi-layer shadow effects
Geometric Spinner: Multi-layered rotating gradients
Slide In Cards: Sequential card transitions
Modern Techniques Used:

CSS transforms (scale, rotate, translate)
Keyframe animations with easing functions
Pseudo-elements (::before, ::after)
3D perspective and transforms
Gradient backgrounds and effects
Box-shadow for glow effects
Backdrop-filter for glass morphism
Animation delays and staggered timing
